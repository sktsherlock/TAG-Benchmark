"About Jim Davis at the Design Research Institute;Jim Davis;Xerox Corporation;PhD, MIT Media Lab 1989;davis@dri.cornell.edu;My goal in general is to build software systems that improve;communication among people. I believe that communication mediums of;the future will have an increasing understanding of the structure and;content of the messages they transmit. They will manipulate,;reformat, and even generate that content. I am interested in;hypertext systems, network information access, and collaboration.;I work on the;CSTR project, an;ARPA sponsored effort to make computer science technical reports more;easily accessible. As part of that work, I designed a distributed technical report server which;is now running at many universities.;I am interested in Corporate (or Group) Memory, meaning electronic;systems for capturing and accessing the knowledge used and produced by;(the workers of) an institution, in order to increase the quality of;or reduce the time required to do future work. Corporate memory;includes not just the intellectual products of the institution;(e.g. an engineer's designs, a lawyer's contracts, an author's;screenplays) but also knowledge about the process that produced;the product: knowledge of dead-ends explored, tools used, and;justifications supporting the final decisions.;I have also begun a project (with Dan Huttenlocher) in developing;corporate memory through shared;annotation of structured documents. This project investigates how;people can share information by reading and writing annotations in;electronic documents shared by the group. An initial prototype;implementation is being used by Cornell class CS212. Here, the shared;documents are problem sets and course notes, and a nnotations might be;requests for clarifications by students, technical questions, or;corrections made by staff. The question is whether this will be a;useful means for students to obtain answers, whether students will;find each other's questions a useful source for learning, whether;students will often be able to answer each other's questions;(correctly), and whether the course staff will find this a useful;means for feedback in improving the course. So far, the evidence is;that they do.; I'm also interested in natural language generation and the design;of computational proxies (""agents"") which can safely and reliably;carry out remote computations on foreign machines without risk to;either you or the owner of the remote machine.;See also;Papers; Online copies of some of my publicatiions.;Web resource for the DRI.; A list of Web resources that seem especially useful for the;DRI;my web resources; Resources I've collected that seem useful (or fun) to me;professional history;This is a narrative, not a resume.;Contact improvisation;Is it a sport or an art?;Resume;No, I'm not in the job market.

"The Horus Project;The Company of;the Gods rejoiced, rejoiced, at the coming of Horus, the son of Osiris,;whose heart was firm, the triumphant, the son of;Isis, the heir of Osiris.;¹;The Horus project has developed a modular and extensible process-group;communication system,;addressing the requirements of a wide variety;of robust distributed applications.;Horus, the son of Isis and of Osiris, was a god whose attributes appealed;strongly to the Egyptians from one end of Egypt to the other, because;in him every man and woman saw the type of what he or she wished to possess,;that is to say, renewed life, and life as opposed to death, and movement;as opposed to inactivity.;²;;Horus provides a framework for the development of distributed applications;based on group communications, a style of computing that can arise in;fault-tolerant systems, managed distributed systems, applications that;exploit data replication or coherent caching, and groupware. Within the;overall Horus framework a large collection of system and application;protocols have been developed that allow the application designer to;construct a communication module that exactly meets the application;requirements at minimal cost.;The Horus project was originally launched as an effort to redesign the;Isis group;communication system, but has evolved into a general purpose communication;architecture with advanced support for the development of robust;distributed systems in settings for which Isis was unsuitable, such as;applications that have special security or real-time requirements. Besides;the practical uses of our software, the project has contributed;towards the theory of virtually synchrony, a runtime model used;for our implementation of data replication and fault-tolerance. At the same;time, our software is much faster and lighter weight than the Isis system.;Horus exists as two systems: an initial version coded in C, which can be;used for research purposes at no fee but has restricted commerical;rights,;and a new version called Ensemble, written in ML but usable from many;other languages, which is available for all classes of users at no;fee. Ensemble is actively under development and we will do series of;releases over the fall of 1996 and spring of 1997. By early in;1997, Ensemble;will be an outstanding environment for building Java-based groupware;applications that do multimedia conferencing on the Web.;Horus and Ensemble are designed to be platform independent, and are;available for different;classes of workstations, personal computers, parallel processors and on;next-generation cluster environments using standard high-speed;communications networks.;The Horus effort collaborates closely with many other distributed systems;projects, including Transis, NavTech, and the StormCast and TACOMA;projects.

Emphasis is on;techniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs.;The subject of the course is programming, not a particular programming;language. The principal programming language is C. The course does not presume;previous programming experience. Programming assignments are tested and run on;interactive, stand-alone microcomputers.;Alternative version of COM S 100, emphasizing examples and applications;involving continuous mathematics, including trigonometry and calculus.;CS100B vs. CS100A;Computer Science 100b basically teaches the same material as CS100a. There are;a some differences, though (besides the last letter). CS100b assumes the;knowledge and/or familiarity with continuous math (as opposed to discrete one),;including trigonometry and calculus. One might wonder what that means in a;programming course. Well, computer science and math interact in many ways and;CS100b introduces one of them - scientific computing. This does not mean that;CS100a is `easier' than CS100b. It means that if you think you are comfortable;with integrals, derivatives, etc., CS100b will show you ways of applying your;knowledge to computer programming. The point of it is not necessarily to;test that knowledge, but rather expand it and apply it. I would;like to encourage people who think they would;qualify to take this course. Continuous math might not sound that attractive,;but you can only benefit with this choice. It is often hard to find good;examples of `real world' problems in an intro course for CS, but CS100b finds;one. If you are not sure whether you `qualify', please talk to the instructor;(Prof. Zabih), and ask him for an opinion.;Besides that, there is a slight difference in the topics taught in 100b and;100a (although, for the most part they coincide one with another). If you;already know a bit about C, CS100b will spend some more time on pointers and;the model of the language itself. If you don't know what this means, it doesn't;matter - just disregard the last sentence.;Grading Policies;Grades for CS100B will be computed as follows:;CS100B course grades;Programs20%;Prelim 110%;Prelim 220%;Prelim 320%;Final 30%;Graded assignments and exams will be returned in sections.

A regrade request can;cause your grade to go up or down - the paper will be regraded from;scratch.;A regrade must be submited within one week after the graded work has;been returned.;Posted Grades: Grades will be posted outside the Carpenter lab by either;srudent ID# or a four-digit code that you give us.

"Computer Science 212;Computer Science 212 Fall 1996;Course Information;August 29, 1996;CS212 is an introductory course covering a broad range of computer;science concepts and techniques, including data abstraction, recursion,;program correctness, generic functions, object oriented programming,;pattern matching, and languages and their evaluators. We use;the Dylan language, an object oriented dynamic language developed;at Apple Computer, which is well suited for covering a broad range;of introductory computer science topics. This is not a course;about the Dylan language, it just happens to be the ""notation"";that we have chosen for writing programs. The major goals of;the course are to teach students how to think clearly about programs;and programming, and to provide a toolbox of modern programming;techniques that will be applicable in any language.;What course to take: Students often wonder whether to take;CS211 or CS212. CS211 focuses on programming skills in the object-oriented;language Java, whereas CS212 provides exposure to a broad range;of computational and programming problems, using a number of programming;paradigms including functional, object-oriented and imperative;programming techniques. If you have a good CS background or good;formal skills (e.g., mathematics or physics) you should probably;take CS212. Transfers between CS211 and CS212 (in either direction);are encouraged during the first two weeks.;Reaching Us;The best way to reach the course staff is by posting questions;or comments using the CS212 Web site http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Current/CS212/; This site contains all course materials, and runs a CoNote server;which allows students and staff to post questions and answers;as ""annotations"" to the handouts and problem sets.;In order to access the Web site you will need to request a user-id;and password for the CoNote system. To do this, simply go to;the CS212 home page and follow the instructions. Your user-id;and password will be created by Monday if you request them this;week.;You can also reach the course staff is by sending email to cs212@cs.cornell.edu;but this should not be used for asking questions about;problem sets or handouts (use the Web site).;Who We Are;Dan Huttenlocher, Professor, 4119 Upson;Tobias Mayr, TA, 5148 Upson;James Hamblin, ugrad TA;Robert Szewczyk, ugrad TA;Justin Voskuhl, ugrad TA;Andras Ferencz, consultant; Melissa Ho, consultant;When We Meet;Lectures are Tuesday and Thursday at 10:10, in B11 Kimball and;recitations are Monday and Wednesday at 1:25, 2:30 or 3:35. Recitations;expand on the material in lecture, and provide more opportunity;to ask questions.;Consulting hours, for help with problem sets or other questions,;will be held from 7pm until midnight the two evenings before each;problem set is due (see schedule below). Thus for problem sets;due on a Tuesday there will be consulting hours Sunday and Monday;evenings and for those due on a Thursday there will be consulting;hours Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. Consulting hours are in;the public Mac lab in B7 Upson.;Office hours are: James Hamblin TBA, Dan Huttenlocher T 1:00-2:00,;Tobias Mayr F 12:15-1:15, Robert Szewczyk TBA, Justin Voskuhl;TBA.;Course Materials;There is no textbook for this course. There will be course handouts;and lecture notes, which will be available both in hardcopy and;on the course Web site.;The Dylan interpreter is available free on the course Web site,;and was developed by Justin Voskuhl for this class. It is implemented;in Java, and thus will run under any Java capable Web browser.; The best current browser (it changes almost weekly) is Netscape;3.0 for Windows95/NT, which has Borland's just-in-time Java compiler.; There are also standalone versions available that you can download;onto your computer if you do not want to use the Web browser version.; One word of warning: if you download a standalone Dylan onto;your machine, make sure that you are using the most recent;version by checking the web site.;Course Requirements;Students are responsible for all material in the assigned readings,;as well as that covered in lectures and in recitations. There;will be six problem sets, two preliminary exams, and a final exam;(a schedule is given below). Each problem set will be a combination;of written exercises and a programming assignment. Course grades;will be based on a combination of the problem sets and exam scores.; The problem sets will account for approximately one half of the;total grade. No late assignments will be accepted (we will;generally grade assignments immediately and return them the following;class period).;You should try to complete the programming assignments early,;as we will not accept late work. The best use of your time and;the machine's time is to think about the problems before sitting;down at the computer. [No matter how many times we say this,;it takes a long time to sink in; think about the problems before;sitting down at the computer.];Policy on Joint Work;Much of the learning in this course comes from doing the programming;problems. You may work jointly with one other person on the assignments;(no more than two people should work together). However, if you;work together with someone, you must submit a single joint;assignment with both names on it. Under no circumstances;may you hand in work done with (or by) someone else under your;own name. If in doubt, credit the person(s) from whom you;got help. You would be amazed at how easy it is to tell when;people work together on problem sets, so please don't make life;unpleasant for all of us by breaking these rules.;Public Lab Facilities;CIT and various colleges on campus provide public Macintosh and;PC facilities, you may use your own machine or the public ones.; The CS department does not provide computer facilities for this;course. The course consultants will be available in the B7 Upson;Mac lab (see above).;Problem Set Due Dates and Exam Dates;All problem sets are due before 2am on the due date. For example,;an assignment due Tuesday must be submitted electronically to;the course server by 2am on Tuesday (that is late Monday;night). No late assignments are accepted, so make sure you submit;your final solution by the correct time and date.;[9/12] Assignment 1;[9/24] Assignment 2;[10/8] Assignment 3;[10/17] Prelim 1, 7:30pm;[10/29] Assignment 4;[11/12] Assignment 5;[11/19] Prelim 2, 7:30pm;[12/5] Assignment 6;[12/19] Final Exam -- see exam schedule;Lecture Outline; [8/29] The Study of Computation, and an Introduction to Dylan; [9/3] Function Abstraction and the Substitution Model of Evaluation; [9/5] Procedures and Processes: Iteration, Recursion and Induction; [9/10] Higher Order Procedures: Functional Arguments and Values; [9/12] Analysis of Algorithms: Orders of Growth; [9/17] Data Abstraction: Structures, Contracts and Implementations; [9/19] Hierarchical Data: Lists, Trees and the need for Quotation; [9/24] Recursive List Processing and Reasoning about Lists; [9/26] Symbolic Differentiation: An Extended Example; [10/1] Generic Operations: Type Dispatching and Generic Functions; [10/3] Generic Operations: Polynomial Arithmetic System; [10/8] Assignment and the Environment Model of Evaluation; [10/10] Assignment and Local State Variables; [10/17] Objects with State and Object Oriented Programming; [10/22] Object Oriented Programming and Inheritance; [10/24] Multimethods and More About Object Oriented Programming; [10/29] Mutable Data: Stacks and Queues; [10/31] Mutable Data: Heaps, Heapsort and Priority Queues; [11/5] The Metacircular Evaluator: Dylan in Dylan; [11/7] Variations on Expression Evaluation; [11/12] Compilation and Optimization; [11/14] Streams; [11/19] Infinite Streams; [11/21] Nonlocal Exits: Catch and Throw; [11/26] Garbage Collection and the Illusion of Infinite Memory; [12/3] Topics in CS: Randomization and Quicksort; [12/5] Topics in CS: Computability;"

It is intended;to give students a solid background in the design and development of database;management systems (DBMS's). Database systems are possibly the world's;largest pieces of software, and certainly among the most valuable pieces;of software. While a DBMS is in one sense a giant application program,;there are surprisingly many principles behind its development and use.;The database industry is growing and thriving, and the demand for knowledgeable;database engineers is much greater than the supply. The database research;community is also active, and there are always new problems to be addressed;because of the explosive amounts of data that people wish to access. This;course forms essential background for anyone who wants to (a) become a;systems engineer at a database development company, or (b) become an informed;user of database systems, or (c) become a database systems researcher,;or (d) develop systems in any domain that manipulate large amounts of data,;or (e) find out how a teller machine really works!;A number of ""advanced fundamental"" DBMS concepts will be covered.;Although this is not intended to be an introductory course, it is a new;course and there may be students in the class with different backgrounds.;Consequently, the discussion of various topics will begin with a quick;review of basic material taught in CS 432. Click here;for a tentative list of topics to be covered.;In terms of workload, here's what the course involves:;There will be a midterm and a final examination. These will test a;breadth of basic concepts.;Each student will have to do a survey paper on a specific advanced;topic. Here is a list of possible topics. The;purpose of this is to be aware that what is being taught in the course;is only a fraction of what is out there. This paper will be due three weeks;after the midterm, and should be complete with references. It will require;reading papers from journals and conference proceedings in the engineering;library. I will suggest initial references, and you will have to pursue;additional references from there. Click here for;information on reference material in the library.;A development project involving C++ programming. Look here;for more information.;There will be no written homework assignments.;Students take turns writing lecture notes. Depending on enrollment,;this means each person will have to take notes once or twice in the semester.;Hopefully, this additional work will turn out to be useful around exam;time. Here are the details (in .ps).; Development;Project;The term project is an important part of the course, and will involve;a significant amount of C++ programming. You can choose whether you wish;to work alone or in teams of two. However, the two-person projects will;involve proportionally more work. The goal of the project is two-fold:;(a) to get hands-on experience at building some specific DBMS component,;(b) to get comfortable working with a large pre-existing code-base, and;modifying it in a modular manner. The second goal is as important as the;first one, because all database systems are huge software systems, and;rarely do you have the luxury of starting from scratch. This forces you;to write modular code, and also to understand the interaction between the;different system components when the inevitable bugs appear.;There are two research DBMS prototypes that will be used in the projects.;One is MINIBASE, which is software associated with the textbook. It is;a simple single-user database system that provides all the components from;the SQL parser down to the disk manager. This should hopefully be available,;depending on our being able to compile and run it in our computing environment.;The important part of MINIBASE is the interface description of the various;system components. The actual code comes from class projects. Consequently,;projects using MINIBASE will involve writing a component (like the buffer;manager), based on a specification of its C++ interface.;The other prototype is PREDATOR, which is a query processing engine;that I have been developing for my research. There are a number of possible;projects (some of which could lead to research topics) that can be built;on top of PREDATOR. The focus here is on the high-end functionality like;complex queries and new data types.;If you are not familiar with C++, I recommend a MINIBASE project because;the amount of design needed is minimal. If you think you are interested;in database systems research, then you should do a PREDATOR project. If;you fall in neither category, then you should decide whether you want a;project at the lower-level DBMS (storage, access, buffer) areas, or the;higher-level (query processing, optimization) areas and choose between;MINIBASE (lower-level) and PREDATOR (higher-level). There are also some;general projects that involve neither system. If you have your own idea;on a suitable project, you should talk with me about it well in advance;of the project proposal date.;Here is a tentative list of possible projects.;In all the projects, there will be certain steps that should be followed:;As part of the project proposal, you should (discuss with me) and submit;an ordered list of pieces of functionality that the project will produce.;There will be a mid-project review in which you meet with me to discuss;the progress that you have made towards completing the project.;The code you write must follow the coding conventions of the particular;system that you are working on. A detailed coding conventions document;will be provided and should be followed closely. This is something that;I will be very picky on, and that will contribute to the grade you get;on the project.;Project submission should include a demo and a reasonable amount of;test data.;Some useful references are:;Home page for PREDATOR.;Home;page for MINIBASE.; Course;TextBook;The primary text is a beta edition of a new book on database systems;: ""Database Management Systems"" by Raghu Ramakrishnan. This book;contains many more details than are in most other introductory database;books. It is also associated with free software for an instructional database;system ""MINIBASE"",;which we might use in class assignments. The textbook is available in the;campus store for $46. Here are other textbooks which could be used as references:;Korth & Silberschatz: Database System Concepts.

The goal;of this course is not to conduct a broad survey of hi-tech programming;languages like C++, Java, or SML, nor to directly study implementation;mechanisms for these languages (e.g., compressed dispatch tables for multiple;inheritance). Rather, the goal of this course is to study;the principles;of formal notation for describing computations, and tools for analyzing;and proving properties of computations. These concerns subsume the;study of specific programming languages or implementation mechanisms;and hence lead to a deeper understanding of programming, specification,;logic, mathematics, and proof theory.;For example, we will study notations for abstractly specifying how;programs compute (operational semantics), as well as;notations for describing what programs compute;(denotational semantics). In turn, the abstract but precise;realization of these notations will allow us to study techniques;(induction, logical relations) for;formally proving interesting and relevant properties of;programming languages (e.g., type safety or compiler correctness).;Ideally, a student coming out of this course will have learned something;about how to make informal concepts and notation precise, and how to;manipulate the notation to demonstrate useful properties.; Textbooks:; Semantics of Programming Languages , Carl A. Gunter.; ML for the Working Programmer (Second Edition) , Larry Paulson.; Prerequisites:;On the programming side,;we assume experience with at least a Pascal- or C-like language.;Preferably, students will have some knowledge and experience working with;a functional language, such as Scheme, ML, or Haskell.;On the theoretical side, we assume a basic proficiency in undergraduate;mathematics, logic, and computer science. A basic knowledge of;computability (e.g., turing machines, recursive functions) and;logic (e.g., predicate calculus), as well as some mathematical;maturity is required.;This course is designed for PhD students in CS, Math,;OR, and EE. It is not for MEng or undergraduate students. If you are an;MEng or undergraduate student, you must talk to the instructor to find out if;the course is suitable for you.; Contact Information:; Newsgroup: cornell.class.cs611; Instructor: Greg Morrisett, Upson 4105C, jgm@cs.cornell.edu, 5-3009; Office Hours: MF after class or by appointment.; Admin.

This is underscored by the fact that;all system manufacturers offer multiprocessors at the top of their product;line. However, the debate on how the parallel machines of the future will;look like has heated-up considerably in the past few months: the federal;spending cuts are on their way to eradicate the performance-at-any-price;massively parallel processor (MPP) manufacturers. Competitors having bet;on glorified workstation farms are smiling: while their machines cannot;offer the same level of performance or ease of use, their business has not;suffered as much because these machines are more price competitive and can;leverage the latest microprocessor developments more quickly. At the core;of the technological debate lie a large number of systems issues: how to;integrate a large number of off-the-shelf processors into a cost-effective;system which can be easily programmed in high-level parallel programming;languages and which can host a varied application workload.;This course is not about how to program parallel machines (although some;of that will be the topic of the first few weeks). Parallel algorithms,;languages and architectures have matured considerably over the last few;years to the point where parallel machines are almost usable, if only the;system support were adequate to allow general-purpose use. This course;will focus on the architecture and operating system aspects required to;support features taken for granted in sequential computing such as;portable parallel programs, powerful debuggers, multi-user machine access,;virtual memory, and fast I/O.;The first part of the course will examine two complete parallel systems:;the CM-5 with Split-C and an ATM network of workstations with CC++. Using;a ``vertical'' approach we will study the interactions between algorithmic;models, languages, associated execution models, operating systems,;architectures and hardware implementations, focussing on the support;required for each of these layers. The second part of the course will;focus on specific topics and slice ``horizontally'' across systems,;selecting a few key issues for an analysis of the design alternatives. An;in-depth study of the KSR and the DASH will provide some shared-memory;contrast to the course.;Course Materials;Course format;Lecture Notes;Problem sets;Term projects;"

"Gerard Salton;Gerard Salton;Professor;gs@cs.cornell.edu;Ph.D. Harvard University, 1958;Natural-language text processing is a rapidly expanding field of research and development. Large masses of machine-readable text now exist that can be cheaply stored on high-density optical storage media and rapidly retrieved on demand. Furthermore, sophisticated methods are available for analyzing document texts, formulating appropriate user queries, conducting rapid file searches, and ranking the retrieved items in decreasing order of importance to the users.;At Cornell, we design and operate large, general-purpose text processing environments where texts can be handled without restrictions as to size or subject matter. In the absence of knowledge bases that would be useful for unrestricted text databases, we use corpus-based text analysis systems that determine the meaning of words and expressions by a refined context analysis using statistical and probabilistic criteria. Using the corpus-based approaches, we are able to determine text similarity with a high degree of accuracy. There are two main applications:;The automatic generation of structured text collections (hypertext) where semantically similar pieces of text are automatically linked. Hypertext representations of large databases provide flexible browsing capabilities for general-purpose text access.;The automatic retrieval of interesting text excerpts in response to available search queries.;We have done extensive work with an automated encyclopedia consisting of about 25,000 encyclopedia articles (the Funk and Wagnalls New Encyclopedia). In addition, we are also processing the TREC collection consisting of about 800,000 full-text documents covering a number of different subject areas (over 2 gigabytes of text).;A sophisticated search and retrieval service exists, as well as a text linking system capable of relating different text sections, paragraphs, and sentences.

I have been investigating a new affine scaling trust region method for minimizing a nonlinear I (sub-1) function; including a trust region convergence analysis.

"Richard Zippel;Richard Zippel;Senior Research Associate;rz@cs.cornell.edu;Ph.D. MIT, 1979;My research focuses on using symbolic mathematics and modern software techniques to automate the generation of scientific software, currently focusing on computational fluid dynamics. This work will allow a scientist to specify the differential equations to be studied, the mathematical techniques that will be used perform the numerical computations and the architecture of the machine on which the calculations will be done. The toolkit then converts the differential equations, via the supplied methods, into specialized code for the architecture. With colleagues in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, this toolkit has been used to generate the dynamical systems that arise in the study of the boundary layers in fluids.;A component of this toolkit is a computer algebra substrate called Weyl, that extends the data structures available in Common Lisp to include objects like polynomials, matrices, rational functions, rings, vector spaces, and ideals. The introduction of these new objects into a programming language provides a number of new challenges to the language's type system and provides new opportunities for deductive reasoning, which we are pursuing.;Professional Activities;Editorial Board: Journal of Symbolic Computation; ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software;Program Committee: Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming Workshop '94;Referee/Reviewer: AOR; NSF; Journal of Algebraic Algorithms and Error Correcting Codes; International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation;Lectures;Algebraic Function Decomposition.

"Kenneth P. Birman;Kenneth P. Birman;Professor;PhD Univ. of California, Berkeley, 1981;My research is concerned with fault-tolerant distributed computing and;operating systems. My focus is on using a distributed programming model;based upon virtual synchronous process groups to solve such problems as;managing replicated data, coordinating actions in a distributed setting,;and performing dynamic reconfiguration. This is done in a way that;provides fault-tolerance, although it is limited to certain classes of;reasonably benign failures.;My effort has a theoretical and a practical side. The practical work;started in 1985, when we developed a computing system called the Isis;Toolkit. Isis, with software tools to support virtual synchrony and;fault-tolerance, became widely popular. We are now developing a new;system, Horus, which is intended to be more flexible than Isis and which;addresses issues such as real-time communication and security.;The most important feature of Horus is its extensive use of layering, which;permits it to be reconfigured for special purposes. The basic idea is that;Horus users should pay only for features that they actually use but should;have available a very broad collection of options. Horus also seeks;leverage from the emergence of ATM network technology and from;communication techniques such as Active Messages, which originated in work;on parallel supercomputers. Horus embodies an advanced security;technology, developed by graduate students Mike Reiter and David Cooper,;which is unusual in combining security, privacy, and high availability in a;single package.;On the more fundamental side of the effort, the Horus group is looking at;techniques for specifying and proving properties of process-group;structured systems. We are using the ML language to develop executable;�reference implementations�� of the major Horus layers, with the goal of;using Constable�s Nuprl system to prove that the latter correctly;implements the former. We are also studying extensions of the virtual;synchrony model, notably in work by Roy Friedman on adding real-time;guarantees to Horus and in work by Mark Hayden on support for probabilistic;broadcast primitives and programming tools.;Horus is very much a collaboration. The architecture and development side;of the effort is headed by Dr. Robbert van Renesse, Werner Vogels and Roy;Friedman. Six graduate students are working on aspects of the system,;including the development of object-oriented programming tools for;multimedia communication applications, security and privacy, high-speed;protocols that exploit ATM, and other problems.

"Keshav Pingali;Keshav Pingali;Associate Professor;PhD MIT, 1986;My research group works in the areas of programming languages and compilers;for parallel architectures.;Our goal is to develop tools for generating parallel code for applications;programs that deal with large sparse matrices. Most scientific;applications involve the numerical solution of partial differential;equations. The techniques used almost always produce a system of algebraic;equations that involve large sparse matrices. Unfortunately, existing;compiler technology does a poor job of parallelizing sparse matrix;programs. We take a radically different approach to this problem. Our;compiler produces parallel sparse-matrix programs from sequential;dense-matrix programs, using information from the user about the sparsity;structure of matrices in the program. This enables us to use tools from;the restructuring compiler area. Preliminary experiments with some Krylov;space solvers show that the code produced by our compiler is competitive;with hand-parallelized code in libraries like Argonne's PetSc library. We;will extend our approach to direct methods for solving linear systems and;to applications that require adaptive mesh refinement.;This project builds on our earlier work on restructuring compilation;techniques for dense matrix programs. We have developed restructuring;techniques for compiling programs to distributed memory and non-uniform;memory access (NUMA) architectures like the IBM SP-2 and CM-5, where a;processor can access local memory faster than non-local memory. To get;good performance, the compiler must not only parallelize but must also;ensure locality of reference by matching code and data distribution; when;non-local references must be made, block transfers are preferable to many;small messages. We recently developed the best algorithm known for the;automatic alignment of computation and data and are incorporating it into;our compiler test-bed. In earlier work, we developed a novel loop;restructuring technique called access normalization, which transforms loop;nests for increased locality and potential for block transfers, and;implemented it in the LAMBDA loop transformation toolkit - our paper;summarizing these results won the best paper prize at ASPLOS V. We worked;with Hewlett-Packard to transfer this technology to HP's FORTRAN compiler;product line for uniprocessors and multiprocessors.;We have developed new frameworks for program analysis and optimization;based on the dependence flow graph (DFG). The DFG knits together the data;and control dependence information of a program, permitting the development;of optimization algorithms that generate better code than is possible with;competing approaches. Our results are of independent interest; for;example, we recently developed optimal algorithms for control dependence;problems, answering a foundational question that had been open for almost;a decade.

My research has focused on the development;of these techniques.;I have been heavily involved in applying assertional reasoning to the;design of concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant, and real-time programs.;I am completing a textbook on this subject. Along with David Gries, I;continue investigations concerning our first-order equational logic E.;This past year, we streamlined the inference rules and evaluated a number;of techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions.;Thomas Bressoud and I completed building and analyzing our hypervisor-based;implementation of replication management for HP's PA-RISC architecture.;Our protocols ensure that the sequence of instructions executed by two;virtual machines running on different physical processors are identical.;The protocols also coordinate I/O issued by these virtual machines. Use of;a hypervisor to implement replica coordination is attractive - at least, in;theory. When replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor, it;instantly becomes available to all hardware realizations of the given;instruction-set architecture, including realizations that did not exist;when the hypervisor was written. Second, when replica coordination is;implemented in a hypervisor, a single implementation suffices for every;operating system that executes on that instruction-set architecture.;Finally, by implementing replica coordination in a hypervisor, the;applications programmer is freed from this task.;Jointly with Dag Johansen (University of Tromsø, Norway) and Robbert van;Renesse, I started the TACOMA project (Tromsø And COrnell Moving Agents) to;investigate support and use of mobile processes in building;mission-critical applications. By structuring a system in terms of agents,;applications can be constructed in which communication-network bandwidth is;conserved. Data may be accessed only by an agent executing at the same;site as the data resides.

To this end, my research group,; Project Zeno,;is building technologies supporting the storage, communication, and;processing of continuous media data. In contrast to other commercial;and research approaches, which require specialized hardware, operating;systems, or networks to be usable, all of these technologies we are;designing fit into the current research environment. Our premise is;that the current hardware, software, and communication infrastructure;is sufficient to support research into continuous media systems and;applications. We are verifying this hypothesis by building working;systems.;Our research on storage systems is directed towards building the Zeno;distributed video file server. The Zeno architecture uses a network of;workstations connected by a generic local area network (e.g., an;ethernet), a common environment in computing research laboratories.;Each workstation can act simultaneously as both a client and a server;of continuous media data. As a client, a workstation plays video;stored on one or more servers. As a server, a workstation is a file;server for video data. Each client can receive video stored at several;servers, and each server can service several clients. Compared with;large centralized servers, the advantages of this design are:; Scalability. As new clients are added, new servers are; automatically added.; Load balancing. The load generated by serving videos is distributed; both across machines and across networks (in the case where the; servers are located on different networks).; Low initial investment. By utilizing existing infrastructure, the; Zeno architecture promotes early adoption in research environments; with almost no initial investment.;Our research on communication systems is centered around best effort;delivery protocols. Such protocols are built on existing network;protocols and, in contrast to many other research efforts, do not need;to reserve network resources to establish a connection. Resource;reservation protocols are well suited to the national communication;infrastructure where users can be charged on a per call basis for;bandwidth and connections, but are poorly suited to network;environments where the network is a shared resource equally accessible;by all researchers. Our approach is appropriate for the latter;environments, commonly found in research laboratories. The;communication protocol we have developed, called Cyclic-UDP, is built;on top of the UDP datagram protocol, and is designed to transport audio;and video data in playback applications in local, metropolitan, and;wide area networks. Cyclic-UDP is used by the Zeno file server to;deliver audio and video data to clients. A; paper describing cyclic UDP is available;online , as well as the; slides from a research talk.;Our research on processing video data has been two-fold. First, we are;developing algorithms to process video data in the compressed;representation. Processing video without decompression leads to;dramatic speed-ups in processing performance since it both removes the;time-consuming processes of compression and decompression and reduces;the amount of data that must be processed. Experiments with an;implementation of these ideas on JPEG compressed image data indicates;that the data can be processed one to two orders of magnitude faster;than what was possible with previous approaches. We are currently;extending these ideas by parallelizing the algorithms using networks of;workstations and by developing a method for transcoding video in;software. In video transcoding, video is translated from one;compression format to another, a useful operation for video file;servers that must service heterogeneous clients.;A paper describing compressed;domain processing is available online.;Our research on video processing is also exploring methods to simplify;experimentation with video processing by developing a programming;language where video is a first class data type. This language, called;Rivl (pronounced ""rival""), allows;video processing effects to be specified independent of the resolution;and format of the source material. The language does for video what;Postscript did for text and graphics: it provides a resolution;independent method for specifying video processing. Thus, the same;program can process low quality QuickTime video very quickly while;editing decisions are made, and then be used to format a high quality;finished product off-line, in much the same way that Postscript can be;previewed on a workstation at low quality, then sent to a 2600 dpi;printer for camera ready copy.;A paper describing RVL;is available online.;A talk that reviews our research on;video processing, both compressed domain processing and Rivl,;is available online.;The common theme of all these efforts is to provide tools to make video;usable in our research environment.;A talk that reviews this research;is also available online.;Teaching;At Cornell University, I teach an undergraduate course (CS 314) on computer;architecture, and a graduate course (CS;631) on multimedia systems.;Selected Publications; Jonathan Swartz, Brian C.

"Robert L. Constable;Robert L. Constable;Department Chair/Professor;rc@cs.cornell.edu;Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Madison, 1968;Research;We are engaged in the study of computer systems that provide;mechanical assistance in problem solving, especially in programming;and mathematics. This involves a long term study of ways to make the;formalization of mathematics feasible and useful. We have implemented;three such systems in the past tne years: PL/CV, PRL, and Nuprl.;Our major experimentation is with Nuprl, a 60,000-line Lisp;program that implements a constructive theory of types. Systems such;as Nuprl are useful formalizations of mathematics because they can;express a wide variety of proof and program-building methods as;metalevel programs of the system. These provide considerable theorem;proving power. Moreover, Nuprl is especially useful because it can;evaluate the computational content of theorems. In principle, Nuprl;is both a fomal system of mathematics and a programming language.;We continue to improve Nuprl; the current version used at Cornell is;called Nuprl 4. It differs from its predecessors in having a new term;editor designed by Stuart Allen and implemented by Richard Eaton. Its;internal structure is more modular, making the system suitable for he;definition of a wide variety of logics beyond the built-in;constructive type theory. Also, the entire theorem-proving mechanism;has been rebuilt and stream-lined by Paul Jackson, building on the;work of Douglas Howe. This contributes to the generic nature of Nuprl;4. Finally, this version of the system can refer to itself. There is;an internal description of the language and its logic built;principally by William Aitken using the theory developed by Allen,;Howe, and myself. Richard Eaton designed a link between the internal;description of the logic and the logic itself, which makes it possible;to prove theorems about the process of proving theorems.;We are also engaged in three exciting joint ventures. One is with;Miriam Leeser of Electrical ENgineering and the other two are in;Computer Science; with David;Gries on Polya and with Richard;Zippel on Weyl. With;Lesser, we are involved in hardware synthesis and verification.;Leeser and her student Mark Aagard have used Nuprl to prove the;correctness of a 1000-line boolean circuit minimization package, Pbs,;used by circuit designers. This is a component of Leeser's Bedroc;system (it implements the weak division algorithm, which is widely;used in circuit design systems). This major theorem proving effort;taught us a great deal about the effectiveness of our technology in;the hands of expert users from an application domain.;The second joint venture involves building a model of the Polya programming language and a;program refinement mechanism for it, both designed by David Gries,;which will enable him to write his handbook of algorithms in the;manner that he devised through years of study of the programming;process. Stuart Allen has givne a formal type-theoretic definition of;Polya. We expect to be experimenting soon with transforms and trying;to capture the programming style that Gries wants.;We have recently begun a collaboration that we hope to relate to the;Polya effort. Conal Mannion has been exploring the possibility of;using Nuprl in computational science. We have been discussing;problems with Richard Zippel and are hoping to connect Zippel's;symbolic algebra system, Weyl, with Nuprl in the near future. This;will be used to explore the development of scientific computing;software using Weyl and Nuprl together with other tools that Zippel is;building.;Professional Activities;Editor, Journal of Symbolic Computation;Editor, Academic Press;Editor, Journal of Logic and Computation;Editor, Oxford University Press;General Chair, LICS;Program Committee, North American Jumelage;Program Committee, Theoretical Aspects of Computer Software;Referee/Reviewer: NSERC (Canada), NSF, Theoretical Computer Science;University Activities;Chair, Computer Science Recruiting Committee;Computer Science Computing Facilities Committee;Provost's Study Committee on Mathematics;Lectures;Formal theories and software systems: fundamental connections between;computer science and logic.

My recent emphasis has been in the areas of subtyping,;object-oriented programming and modularity. I am implementing a practical programming language KML;which combines these features in a functional programming language, and formulating for it a;type-theoretic semantics.;An interesting view of programming languages is as a tractable approximation to the intractably rich;world of foundational type theories, in which the whole of mathematics can be performed. New;programming language developments often result from mapping type-theoretic constructions through an;approximation into a programming language setting, and, conversely, new paradigms in programming;languages are often not well understood until they have been formulated type-theoretically. I am;interested in deepening our understanding of this relationship between type theory and programming;languages, particularly the issues of tractability and approximation and how they can be mitigated.;I am also interested in a model of compilation that views it as a series of translations into;""lower"" intermediate calculi, where each intermediate calculus can be embedded into type theory and;the corresponding interpretation of a program is invariant under each translation. Such a model;allows us to relate each stage of compilation to an original type-theoretic semantics, which allows;the use of standard compilation techniques and optimizations while guaranteeing safety and;correctness. Also, careful formulation of such intermediate calculi make possible additional;optimizations that are unavailable in other compilation strategies.;My work forms part of the;Nuprl project here;at Cornell.

"David Cooper's Home Page; David Cooper; Postdoctoral Associate; 4112 Upson Hall; Phone: 607-255-9222; Email: dcooper@cs.cornell.edu; Current Research;My current research involves the design and implementation of a security;architecture for;Horus. The goal of this work is to provide a layer to Horus;which will interact with; The Kerberos;Network Authentication Service and other cryptographic tools in order to;provide privacy and authentication services to processes in a group setting.;The original security architecture for Horus was implemented by Mike Reiter;(see;A Security Architecture for Fault-Tolerant Systems). In the original;implementation of;Horus, all process groups supported the virtual synchrony model of;computation. In order to maintain virtual synchrony (in the crash failure;model used in;Horus), it is necessary for all processes within a group to be honest. As;a result, the original security architecture makes the assumption that any;process which is allowed to join a group is trusted by all of the group members.;In the current version of; Horus, it is;possible to maintain process groups whose semantics are weaker than those of;virtual synchrony. In such groups, it may be desirable to permit untrusted;processes to join. An example of this might involve allowing untrusted clients;to join a client/server group. In such a setting, servers would communicate;with untrusted clients, but would only accept a limited set of commands from;the clients (and would be responsible for screening out all other messages).;The new Horus;security architecture will permit arbitrary trust relationships;among the processes within a group. This is accomplished by using a key;management scheme which does not allow one process in a group to impersonate;another group member. Using this scheme, a process group may trivially achieve;the semantics provided by the original security architecture (however with;a slightly higher overhead). However, unlike the original security architecture,;the new architecture enables the implementation of groups (such as;client/server groups) which many have more complicated trust relationships;among group members.; Thesis Research;In my thesis, I proposed a set of solutions to the privacy problems inherent;in mobile networks. In a static network, there are two basic types of;information which users may wish to keep private. The first is the contents;of the messages that they send to other users. This information can be hidden;with the proper use of encryption. Users may also wish to prevent outsiders;from determining with whom they are communicating. A solution to maintaining;the unlinkability of message senders and recipients was first proposed in 1981;by David Chaum;(Communications of the ACM, February 1981). Since then, several;others have made improvements to the original scheme.;In a mobile network, in addition to the types of information in a static;network, there is also location information. Users who carry mobile;communications devices will, in general, desire privacy. However, the;messages that their devices send and receive may reveal private information;about the devices' owners. In my research, I developed, along with my advisor;Ken Birman, a set of protocols to prevent such attacks from both internal;and external adversaries.; Publications;David A. Cooper and Kenneth P.

Topics include process;synchronization, deadlock, memory management, input-output methods,;information sharing, protection and security, and file systems. The;impact of network and distributed computing environments on operating;systems is also discussed. This is a fast-paced subject requiring;constant attention.;1.1 Prerequsites;Complete familiarity with the material of CS314 is assumed. In;particular, a knowledge of computer architecture, assembly programming;language and program structure is required. I'll cover some of the;introductory material in class as required, but the purpose of that;will be to remind the audience of the material.;1.2 Course Outline;The course will be organized roughly as follows. I say roughly,;because depending on the feedback from the class, I may change the;order or the content of particular sections.; We'll start off with an overview of concurrency issues. We'll;discuss synchronization issues - in particular, ensuring mutual;exclusion, deadlock detections and prevention algorithms. We'll;discuss multiprocessor issues as well. Next, we'll go on to memory;management. Here we'll discuss virtual memory and various methods used;to implement virtual memory, such as paging and segmentation. Next,;we'll cover file systems. Finally, we'll look at evolution of the;traditional operating systems and look at micro-kernels. If time;permits, we'll have a few lectures on advanced topics such as multi;threading and serverless file systems.;1.3 Textbooks;The principal text book for the class is the Operating System Concepts;book by Abraham Silberschatz and Peter Galvin. I'll also distribute;class notes which will cover the material completely. The class notes;will also be available on the world wide web from the class home page;at the end of each class.;2 Course Schedule We will meet Monday;thru Thursday from 10:00AM-11:15AM during the weeks of 7/8 -;8/16. There will be two in-class quizzes. The first will be on 7/18;and the second will be on 8/1. The final will be on 8/16. In addition,;there will be weekly assignments for the first 5 weeks of class. These;will be handed out on Thursday and will be due the following Thursday;at the start of the class.;3 Quizzes & Grading;Each of the homeworks will carry a weightage of 6% for a combined;weightage of 30%. The final will be worth 40% and there will be two;midterms worth 15% each. There will also be 4 surprise quizzes to;determine the understanding of the course material by the class.;4 Policy Statement on Collaboration;At most 3 people can form a group and collaborate on each;homework.

The domains of these;applications include financial management, historical analysis,;economic and social sciences, metereology, medical sciences and;biological sciences. Existing relational databases are inadequate in;this regard; data collections are treated as sets, not sequences.;Consequently, expressing sequence queries is tedious, and evaluating;them is inefficient.;Databases should;model the data using the abstraction of sequences ,;allow data sequences to be queried in a declarative manner ,;utilizing the ordered semantics;take advantage of the unique opportunities available for query;optimization and evaluation;integrate sequence data with relational data, so that users can;store and query a combination of relation and sequences;These requirements serve as the goals of the SEQ project.;Various kinds of sequences need to be supported, temporal sequences being the;most important kind. Queries should be expressible using notions like;""next"" and ""previous"" which are natural when considering sequences.;These queries should be optimized so that they can be evaluated efficiently.;These issues need to be studied in theory, and then a database system needs;to be built that demonstrates the feasibility of the theoretical ideas.;Project Status;The current status of the project is:;We have defined the SEQ data model that can support;most important kinds of sequence data. We have also defined algebraic;query operators that can be composed to form sequence queries (analogous;to the composition of relational algebra operators to form relation queries).;We have described how sequence queries can be efficiently processed,;and have identified various optimization techniques.;We use a sequence query language Sequin that can;declaratively express queries over sequences. A Sequin;query can include embedded expressions in a relational query language like;SQL, or vice-versa.;We are building a disk-based database system to demonstrate the;feasibility of our proposals. The system implements the SEQ;model using a nested complex object architecture. It is built over the;SHORE storage manager and can process several megabytes of data.;Relations and sequences are supported in an integrated and extensible;manner.;Motivating Example of a Sequence Query;A weather monitoring system records information about various meteorological;phenomena. There is a sequentiality in the occurrence of these phenomena; the;various meteorological events are sequenced by the time at which they are;recorded. A scientist asks the query:; ""For which volcano eruptions did;the most recent earthquake have a strength greater than 7.0 on the Richter;scale?"".;If this query is to be expressed in a relational query language like SQL,;complex features like groupby clauses, correlated subqueries and aggregate;functions are required. Further, a conventional relational query optimizer;would not find an efficient query execution plan, even given the knowledge;that the Earthquakes and Volcano relations are sorted by time.;However a very efficient plan exists, if one models the data as sequences;ordered by time. The two sequences can be scanned in lock step;(similar to a sort merge join). The most recent earthquake record scanned;can be stored in a temporary buffer. Whenever a volcano record is;processed, the value of the most recent earthquake record stored in the;buffer is checked to see if its strength was greater than 7.0, possibly;generating an answer. This query can therefore be processed with a single;scan of the two sequences, and using very little memory. The key to such;optimization is the sequentiality of the data and the query.;Data Model;The details of the SEQ data model are;described in a published paper (click here;for postscript version). Here we present the gist of it.;The basic model of a sequence is a set of records mapped to an ordered;domain of ``positions''.;This many-to-many relationship between records and;positions can be viewed in two dual but distinct ways: as a set of records;mapped to each position, or as a set of positions mapped to each record.;These two views are called ``Positional'' and ``Record-Oriented'' respectively,;and each gives rise to a set of query operators based on that view.;Queries on sequences could require operators of either or both flavors.;The Record-Oriented operators are similar to relational;operators and include various kinds of joins (overlap, containment, etc) and;aggregates. Such operators have been extensively explored by researchers;in the temporal database community.;The Positional operators include Next, Previous, Offset, Moving;Aggregates, etc. Further operators allow ``zooming'' operations on;sequences by means of collapsing and expanding the ordering domains;associated with the sequence. For instance, a daily sequence could be;``zoomed out'' (i.e.collapsed) to a weekly sequence, or ``zoomed in'';(i.e. expanded) to an hourly sequence.;The last part of the model deals with operations on groups (i.e. sets) of;sequences. The advantage is that this makes it easy to model queries;involving sequence collections (which is the case in many real-world;situations). All the sequence operators are extended to work with groups;of similar sequences, instead of with single sequences. This extension;of the SEQ model indicates that a practical implementation of;SEQ would probably involve a nested complex object system.; Sequin Query Language;We have devised a query language called Sequin using;which declarative sequence queries can be specified. The language;is similar in flavor to SQL, except that the inputs to queries;as well as the results of queries are sequences. Click; here for a description of the Sequin;language with examples.;Optimization Techniques;We have proposed new optimization techniques for sequence queries;involving Positional operators. There are existing techniques that;have been proposed for queries with Record-Oriented operators.;Our optimizations use query transformations, meta--data, and caching of;intermediate results to efficiently evaluate a query. An optimal query;evaluation plan can be generated using an algorithm that relies on cost;estimates. One of the important observations is that accessing sequence data;in a single stream is probably very efficient, and evaluation strategies;should take this into account.;The details of the optimization techniques are;described in a published paper (click here;for postscript version).;System Development;The SEQ database system has a client-server;architecture, supporting multiple clients via;a multi-threaded server. The server is built on;top of the SHORE;storage manager. Both Sequin;and a subset of SQL are supported as query languages;which can be embedded inside each other. The data model;is a nested complex object model that allows arbitrary;levels of nesting of relations inside sequences and vice;versa. The system is also extensible, providing support;for new data types, new ordering domains, user-defined functions,;new storage implementations and new query languages.

"Faculty Research Interests : Sam Toueg Sam Toueg;Professor;Ph.D., Princeton University, 1979;Research Interests;My research interests include distributed computing, fault-tolerance;and real-time. I work on methodologies, paradigms, and algorithms for;fault-tolerant distributed systems, in both message-passing and;shared-memory systems. My long-term goal is to bridge the gap;between theoretical results and the need for efficient and practical;solutions.;In collaboration with;Tushar Chandra;and;Prasad Jayanti,;two Ph.D.;Computer Science students, we continued our work on;unreliable failure;detectors for message-passing systems,;and on wait-free objects for shared-memory systems.;A fundamental result of fault-tolerant distributed computing;states that the Consensus problem cannot be solved (with a;deterministic algorithm) in asynchronous systems. This impossibility;result is due to the inherent difficulty of determining whether a;process has crashed (or is merely very slow) in such a system. In;our work, we were able to determine exactly how much information;about failures is necessary and sufficient to solve Consensus. We;first showed one can use W, an unreliable failure detector that can;make an infinite number of mistakes, to solve Consensus in systems;with a majority of correct processes. We then proved that to solve;Consensus, any failure detector has to provide at least as much;information about failures as W. Thus, W is the weakest failure;detector for solving Consensus in asynchronous systems with a;majority of correct processes. We are now exploring the practicality;of implementing W, and of applications that rely on W for their;correctness.;A concurrent system consists of processes communicating via shared;objects. A shared object is wait-free if each process that accesses;this object is guaranteed to get a response even if all the other;processes crash. We are now exploring wait-free hierarchies of;object types, where each object (type) is assigned to a level that;corresponds to its ability in implementing other wait-free objects.;In particular, Prasad Jayanti has shown that a well-known hierarchy;(Herlihy's) is not robust: Informally, in this hierarchy there is an;object at level 2 that can be used to implement wait-free objects at;any level. We are now exploring the question of whether;robust wait-free hierarchies exist.;Selected Publications; Bracha, G., and S.

This paper investigates the use of Active Messages;(AM) communication primitives as an alternative to the standard;message passing in order to reduce communication overheads and to;offer a good building block for higher layers of software.;The first part of this paper describes an implementation of Active;Messages (SP AM) which is layered directly on top of the SP's network;adapter (TB2). With comparable bandwidth, SP AM's low overhead yields;a round-trip latency that is 40% lower than IBM MPL's. The second;part of the paper demonstrates the power of AM as a communication;substrate by layering Split-C as well as MPI over it. Split-C;benchmarks are used to compare the SP to other MPPs and show that low;message overhead and high throughput compensate for SP's high network;latency. The MPI implementation is based on the freely available;MPICH version and achieves performance equivalent to IBM's MPI-F on;the NAS benchmarks.;Design and Performance of Active Messages on the;SP-2;Chi-Chao Chang, Grzegorz Czajkowski, and Thorsten von Eicken,;Cornell CS Technical Report 96-1572, February 1996.;Abstract:;This technical report describes the design, implementation, and;evaluation of Active Messages on the IBM SP-2. The implementation;benchmarked here uses the standard TB2 network adapter firmware but;does not use any IBM software on the Power2 processor.

This paper examines whether these;techniques can carry over to clusters of workstations connected by an;ATM network even though clusters use standard operating system;software, are equipped with network interfaces optimized for stream;communication, do not allow direct protected user-level access to the;network, and use networks without reliable transmission or flow;control.;In a first part, this paper describes the differences in;communication characteristics between clusters of workstations built;from standard hardware and software components and state-of-the-art;multiprocessors. The lack of flow control and of operating system;coordination affects the communication layer design significantly and;requires larger buffers at each end than on multiprocessors. A second;part evaluates a prototype implementation of the low-latency Active;Messages communication model on a Sun workstation cluster;interconnected by an ATM network. Measurements show;application-to-application latencies of about 20 microseconds for small;messages which is roughly comparable to the Active Messages;implementation on the Thinking Machines CM-5 multiprocessor.;Active Messages: a Mechanism for Integrated Communication and;Computation.;von Eicken, T., D. E. Culler, S. C. Goldstein, and K. E. Schauser,;Proceedings of the 19th Int'l Symp. on Computer Architecture,;May 1992, Gold Coast, Australia.;Abstract;The design challenge for large-scale multiprocessors is (1) to;minimize communication overhead, (2) allow communication to overlap;computation, and (3) coordinate the two without sacrificing;processor cost/performance. We show that existing message passing;multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs. Research;prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication;overhead, but poor processor cost/performance. We introduce a simple;communication mechanism, Active Messages, show that it is;intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the;hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility. Implementations on nCUBE/2;And CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory;extension to C, Split-C. We further show that active messages;are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for;which message driven machines were designed. With this mechanism,;latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern.

"HORUS DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT;HORUS DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT; Kenneth Birman (ken@cs.cornell.edu); Robbert van Renesse (rvr@cs.cornell.edu);Cornell's;Horus effort has developed a programming environment for reliable;distributed computing. During the last year, Horus was used to demonstrate;groupware and fault-tolerance over high performance networks, and was found;to offer higher performance than other similar systems. Novel features of;Horus are its flexible software architecture, in which applications;pay only for features that they use, and support for virtually synchronous;process groups, a technology that we developed in our prior work on the; Isis;Toolkit, which has become a significant commercial success. Horus also offers;a fault-tolerant; security;and privacy technology, which we view as an important;research advance.;During 1995, we will be extending Horus to provide extremely low latency,;high performance;real-time capabilities. Our approach combines elements of;a communication technology called;Active Messages;with a multi-media playback;system called;Continuous Media. By the end of the year, we expect to;demonstrate high speed interactive applications with remote multimedia;servers, such as might be used in remote telemedicine applications or video;on demand systems. All of this will retain the existing fault-tolerance and;security options of Horus, and its virtual synchrony programming model.;Prior work on; Isis;has created a substantial user base, and we expect;rapid uptake of Horus within this community as it matures. Isis users span;a wide range of industries, including telecommunications systems, financial;trading systems, stock market automation, factory-floor process control for;discrete electronic component manufacture, air traffic control, and space-based;communications system management and control. Applications of Isis are being;explored in several branches of the military, as well as the NSA and other;non-military government branches. Among the more visible military efforts is;the Naval Hiper-D project, which is exploring the use of Isis in a new system;that prototypes technologies for future enhancements of the AEGIS battle;radar system. The more demanding applications in this user base would benefit;from access to Horus, and our initial plan is to make it possible to migrate;Isis applications to Horus with few changes, thus benefiting this community;in a direct way. Technology transition has occured through licensing agreements;with Isis Distributed Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Stratus Computers. However,;all of our Cornell work is also available to researchers at no fee, and is;described through detailed publications and programming manuals.;Looking to the future, we hope that a mixture of Isis and Horus technologies;will permit us to develop some of the very demanding applications that will be;seen in next-generation groupware and planning systems. The illustration below;shows such an application: a military mission control and planning system;that integrates data from a variety of space, air and ground resources and;uses this to coordinate actions of various theatre assets. Systems of this;sort will demand the utmost in performance, reliability and security, while;also tolerating failures and rapidly reconfiguring to respond to changing;demands. Success in our project will thus impact a wide range of both civilian;and military technology efforts.;Dept. of Computer Science / Cornell University / ken@cs.cornell.edu;"
