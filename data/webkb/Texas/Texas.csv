I seek to use;the dramatic advances in computing technology over the past few;decades to make equally dramatic advances in our understanding of the;human mind. With the computing power now available and soon to be;available, realistic simulations of cortical processing are becoming;practical. This enables us to make (and, if necessary, refute);testable hypotheses about brain function. The overall goal is to make;cognitive research into an empirical science, rather than the purely;philosophical domain it has been for centuries.;My master's thesis, ``Tilt Aftereffects in a Self-Organizing Model of;the Primary Visual Cortex'', is nearly complete. The abstract:; Visual illusions and aftereffects have long been studied by; psychologists and vision researchers because these apparent functional; failures might offer insight into how visual processing is carried out; by the brain. A particular class of visual illusions called tilt; illusions and tilt aftereffects are thought to arise in the primary; visual cortex of humans, and thus serve as test cases for theories; about that area of the brain. Specifically, several researchers have; proposed that they result from lateral inhibition between neurons; receiving visual input.;; The thesis examines tilt illusions and aftereffects in;; RF-LISSOM (Sirosh and Miikkulainen, 1995), a self-organizing model; of the primary visual cortex that incorporates such lateral interactions.; It is demonstrated that the self-organizing principles driving RF-LISSOM; result in aftereffects which are qualitatively and quantitatively; similar to those measured in humans. On the basis of these results,; a new explanation for so-called ``indirect effects'' (interactions; between lines with very different orientations) is proposed in the; thesis. The self-organizing model should also apply to other figural; aftereffects, such as spatial frequency aftereffects, which we predict; result from the same lateral interaction processes.;A preliminary report of the research is available as;a PostScript file. I am also beginning my doctoral research,;which will include further simulations of detailed low-level visual;behavior, using an extension of the RF-LISSOM model.;Contact Information; Email: jbednar@cs.utexas.edu; Mailing address:; The University of Texas at Austin; Department of Computer Sciences ,; TAY 2.124; Austin , TX 78712-1188; Information from the finger command; Machines I am logged into in this department;My resume, in Postscript or ASCII format; Links to the Web (Probably outdated.); Old Papers (Not too interesting.);jbednar@cs.utexas.edu;Last updated: July 9, 1996;",student,61,2,3124,[131]

References to such sources will be given in class;at the appropriate time.;Lectures: 9:00-10:30 Monday and Wednesday, in Robert Lee Moore Hall;5.124.;The newsgroup for the class is;utexas.class.cs380d.;Required Textbook; Distributed Systems, Second Edition, S. Mullender (editor), ACM;Press, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading MA, 1994.;Course Content;CS380 covers abstractions that have proved useful or are expected to;be useful for designing and building tomorrow's distributed;systems. These include:; global states (cuts, logical and vector clocks, causal message;delivery, global property detection); message logging and checkpointing; replication management (state machine approach, primary backup;approach); agreement protocols (Byzantine agreement, ordered multicast); group programming (techniques and applications); distributed file systems (caching, disconnected operations); time services (Byzantine clock synchronization, NTP); security (encryption, authentication, security in group programming);We will integrate the discussion of the general principles with the;presentation of case studies that exemplify how such principles;have been used to design and implement real systems.;Other topics, depending on time and interest, will be presented by me;or by some of you (the size of the class does not allow all of you to give a;presentation). Such topics may include:; distributed shared memory; distributed objects; kernel support for distributed systems; weak consistency for replica management; protocols for electronic commerce; protocols for wide-area networks;Grading;There will be 4 or 5 written homework assignment. Solutions will be;graded F, B, or A. Any solution that demonstrates a credible effort on;behalf of its authors (whether the solution is right or wrong) will;receive a B or better.;Collaboration on homework assignment by up to three students is;permitted and encouraged, but not required. When there is such a;collaboration, a single solution should be submitted for;grading, with the names of the collaborators. Other collaborations;will be considered violations of Academic Integrity.;There will be a written, take-home midterm examination, for which no;collaboration will be allowed.;There will be no final exam. Each student however will be required to;write a final paper (about 20 pages) that surveys one of the issues;that we have discussed in class. A list of suggested topics will be;distributed in class on Monday 4/8. The paper is due at the start of;the last class, Wednesday 5/1: hence, you will have 4 weeks to;complete the paper.;You can also team up with a colleague and prepare one or two;lectures on a topic not previously covered in class. If you choose;this option, you and your colleague will only be required to write a;single survey paper of about 20 pages. I warmly encourage you to;consider volunteering for a presentation: it will give you an excellent;opportunity to improve your communication skills.;Problem Sets;In this and all subsequent problem sets, you should;conform to the following general guidelines:; ``Prove'' and ``show'' are synonymous. A precise proof is;required when you are asked to ``prove'' or ``show'' something.; To show that something is impossible, you have to give a proof that;makes it clear that the problem cannot be solved, no matter what the algorithm;is. It is insufficient to show that a particular algorithm does not work.; Any algorithm that you develop must be accompanied by a proof of;correctness, unless you explicitly told otherwise.; Due: Mon, 5 Feb 1996;Problem 1; The snapshot protocols discussed in class and in the;textbook assume that communication channels are FIFO. Derive a;snapshot protocol for an asynchronous system that does not depend on;the FIFO assumption, and prove it correct (i.e. prove that the;protocol produces a consistent global state). You may assume that at;most one snapshot is being computed at any point during a run.; Note: The book contains a reference to a paper by Mattern that;contains a solution to the problem. I urge you to resist the;temptation to solve the problem by visiting the library...;Problem 2; Taking the snapshot of a distributed computation is a;general technique for computing stable global predicates. More;efficient protocols can be derived for computing specific predicates,;that are often conceptually simpler and more efficient (in terms of;the number of messages they exchange) than a snapshot-based solution.;In this problem you are required to derive such a ``specialized'';protocol for detecting a deadlock in an asynchronous distributed;system. Ideally, your protocol would not need a centralized monitor;process, and would have a message cost of O(n), where n;is the number of processes in the distributed system (a monitor-based;snapshot protocol for detecting deadlock has a cost of O(n*n)).;The suggested solutions to these problems are now;online. This link points to the postscript file.; Due: Wed, 28 Feb 1996, 0900;This link points to the postscript file;describing the second homework assignment.;The final exam;The assignment constituting the final exam is due by 5 p.m., Friday;May 3, 1996.;This link points to the;Postscript file describing the assignment.;If you have questions, feel free;to send email to Lorenzo or to; Rajeev .;If you have ideas on improving this page, please send your;suggestions to; joshi@cs.utexas.edu;Rajeev Joshi, last updated 11 Apr 1996;",course,63,0,6255,[80]

Texas at Austin.;The long-term goal of our research is to develop technology for;constructing and using large, multifunctional knowledge bases on;computers. These knowledge bases would significantly improve current;expert systems and tutoring systems because they contain the broad;knowledge of a domain required to perform multiple tasks and to;explain domain knowledge from multiple viewpoints.;During the past eight years, we have built a large knowledge base in;one area of biology, and developed methods for automatically answering;a variety of questions using the knowledge base. Containing about;180,000 facts concerning 30,000 concepts, our knowledge base is one of;the largest of its kind (i.e. its content is structured and formally;represented). In addition to expanding this knowledge base, we are;also beginning to construct similar knowledge bases in other domains,;most notably, the domain of Distributed Computing.;We are especially encouraged by the results from using our knowledge;base for a variety of AI tasks. Most recently, James Lester used the;biology knowledge base to test his system for explanation generation.;The system generated about 60 explanations, expressed in English,;concerning biological objects and events. In a controlled experiment,;domain experts found little difference between these explanations and;those written by their colleagues.;Currently, we are extending the types of questions that can be;answered using automated reasoning with a large knowledge base. Jeff;Rickel developed a method for ""compositional modeling"", the task;of constructing a model appropriate for answering a prediction;(""what-if"") question. Performing this task well requires building the;simplest model that can adequately answer the question - a daunting;requirement since knowledge bases like ours implicitly contain MANY;models at numerous levels of detail. The Qualitative Process Compiler;and QSIM are used to simulate the models built by Jeff's program.;Finally, we are testing the generality of our research results by;building a knowledge base in another domain - distributed computing;environments (focussing on OSF's DCE) - to construct a help-desk;assistant for automatically answering a proportion of customer's;questions which would otherwise be phoned in to a normal help-desk.;Research Projects;Our completed and ongoing research projects include:; KM/KQL; - our knowledge representation language,; KnEd; - the knowledge base editor,; BKB; - the biology knowledge base,; KASTL; - the viewpoint retriever,; KNIGHT; - explanation and text planning,; FARE; - natural language generation of text plans,; LexEd; - computer-aided maintenance for KB lexicons,; TRIPEL; - compositional modeling for answering prediction questions,; Help-Desk Assistant; - the DCE Help-Desk Assistant project.;Researchers; Bruce Porter; (porter@cs.utexas.edu); Rich Mallory; (mallory@cs.utexas.edu); Art Souther; (souther@cs.utexas.edu); Charles Callaway; (theorist@cs.utexas.edu); Fred Prado (prado@cs.utexas.edu); Carl Andersen (searcher@cs.utexas.edu); Steve Correl (correl@cs.utexas.edu);Recent alumni and alumnae:; Liane Acker (acker@austin.ibm.com); Erik Eilerts; (eilerts@cs.utexas.edu); Ray Bareiss (bareiss@ils.nwu.edu); Brad Blumenthal; Karl Branting; (karl@eolus.uwyo.edu); Peter Clark; (clarkp@redwood.rt.cs.boeing.com);; James Lester (lester@adm.csc.ncsu.edu); Ken Murray (murray@cyc.com); Jeff Rickel (rickel@isi.edu);Publications;Click;here to see some selected publications from our group.;Other Related KB Projects;Click here;for an extensive collection of pointers to other KB projects around;the world.;porter@cs.utexas.edu;",project,92,1,3926,[]

Such tasks can;be characterized by the following scenario: An agent observes a state;of a dynamic system and selects from a finite set of actions. The;system then enters a new state upon which the agent must select;another action. The system may return a payoff for each decision made;or for a sequence of decisions. The objective is to select the;sequence of actions that return the highest total or cumulative;payoff.

Fault-tolerance will;cease to be an expensive feature required by a handful of applications;to tolerate exotic failures. To the users of a highly distributed;information infrastructure, fault-tolerance will translate to a;competitive advantage, guaranteeing reliable access to critical;information.;In this talk we will explore a new way to design and engineer;fault-tolerant solutions, which we call lightweight fault-tolerance.;The goals of lightweight fault-tolerance are:;To require few dedicated resources and have a negligible;impact on performance during failure-free executions.;To scale its cost depending on the severity and number of;failures that need to be tolerated.;To integrate with applications in a way transparent to the;application programmer.;To enable and support emerging applications that will communicate;through messages as well as files.;To address software-generated faults effectively.;Cilk and Cilk-NOW: Adaptive and Reliable Parallel Computing on;Networks of Workstations;Robert Blumofe;This presentation overviews Cilk (pronounced;""silk""), an algorithmic parallel multithreaded language, and;Cilk-NOW, a runtime system that supports a functional;subset of Cilk on networks of workstations. Cilk-NOW provides;""adaptive parallelism"" and fault tolerance tranparently to;user programs. Adaptive parallelism means that the set of;workstations on which a Cilk program runs can grow and shrink;dynamically depending on the availability of idle workstations and on;the amount of parallelism within the program. In addition, a Cilk;program can continue execution even if one or more of its workstations;crashes, because the Cilk-NOW runtime system automatically detects and;recovers from such failures. The presentation includes a live;demonstration.;Distributed I/O: from Clusters to Internets;Mike Dahlin;This presentation gives an overview of current issues in;distributed file system I/O. Technology trends and new applications;motivate more aggressive cluster and wide area network I/O systems. In;clusters, fast networks allow machines to cooperate closely to service;I/O requests. The xFS file system uses close cooperation among nodes;to provide better performance and availability than a single central;server. In wide area networks, the challenge is to provide good;performance, availability, and consistency despite limited network;performance and node or network failures. The wFS file system project;will explore these issues.;The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy for Human and Robot Cognitive Maps;Benjamin Kuipers;Human cognitive maps rely on several different representations for;large-scale space, each with its own ontology. Similarly, a variety;of different approaches have been proposed for robot exploration and;mapping of unknown environments. We cast these diverse;representations into a natural structure that we call the Spatial;Semantic Hierarchy (SSH), in which the objects, relations, and;assumptions at each level are abstracted from the levels below.;Each level of the SSH has its own mathematical foundation. The;control level allows the robot and its environment to be formalized as;a continuous dynamical system, whose stable equilibrium points can be;abstracted to a discrete set of ""distinctive states."";Trajectories linking these states can be abstracted to actions, giving;a discrete causal graph representation of the state space. The causal;graph of states and actions can in turn be abstracted to a topological;network of places and paths. Local metrical models, such as occupancy;grids, of neighborhoods of places and paths can then be built on the;framework of the topological network without their usual problems of;global consistency.;Mathematical Principles of Logic Programming;Vladimir Lifschitz;Logic programming, as well as its sister approach, functional;programming, is based on the view that a computer program does not;need to contain any explicit operational instructions. Instead, it;can simply provide a set of facts about the problem that is sufficient;to solve it. Such a ""declarative"" program can be executed;using methods of automated reasoning. Prolog is the best known logic;programming language.;The mathematical theory of logic programming is concerned with;defining the semantics of logic programming languages, describing the;reasoning algorithms used to implement them, and investigating the;soundness of these algorithms.;Adaptive Libraries and High Level Optimization;Calvin Lin;This talk describes a new approach to building software libraries.;By making libraries that can adapt---in both their implementation and;their interfaces---to different application needs and different;hardware platforms, we can produce libraries that are more efficient;and more widely usable. We describe a new framework for building such;libraries, we describe three planned experiments that apply these;techniques to libraries for parallel scientific computation, and we;explain how our approach facilitates high level optimizations.;Learning Sequential Decision Tasks Through Symbiotic Evolution of;Neural Networks;Risto Miikkulainen;A novel reinforcement learning method called SANE;(Symbiotic, Adaptive Neuro-Evolution) evolves a population of neurons;through genetic algorithms to form a neural network for a given task.;Symbiotic evolution promotes both cooperation and specialization in;the population, which results in a fast, efficient genetic search and;discourages convergence to suboptimal solutions. SANE is able to;extract domain-specific information even under sparse reinforcement,;which makes it an effective approach to a broad range of sequential;decision tasks such as robot control, game playing, and resource;management.;Alamo: The Net as a Data Warehouse;Dan Miranker;The Alamo effort is directed at intra-net development, and;inter-net users who can enumerate interesting sites and data;sources. The goal is to integrate the data sources and provide the;user with the illusion of a single virtual database, followed by;query, analysis and presentation tools.;Central to the Alamo architecture is a software bus called the;Abstract Search Machine (ASM). The ASM is a CORBA compliant interface;that provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous data;sources. Beyond simple data access, the ASM embodies a higher level of;abstraction enabling the efficient coding of clever search algorithms;and separating and isolating system concerns, including buffering and;data prefetch.;The broad claim is that high performance, often optimal,;implementations of advanced database facilities such as an;object-oriented query engine, a deductive inference engine, an active;database engine and data mining facilities can all be constructed;using the ASM as a common interface.;Finally, since the output of each of these advanced database;facilities can themselves serve as data sources, the components of the;Alamo architecture can be composed to resolve higher level data;integration problems. In particular we anticipate using the elements;of Alamo itself to represent meta-data and resolve both structural and;semantic conflicts among the data sources. Ultimately, further;compositions will embody complex knowledge-bases and be able to answer;high-level queries.;Learning to Process Natural Language Using Inductive Logic;Programming;Raymond J. Mooney;Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) addresses the problem of learning;Prolog programs from examples. The representational power of;first-order logic offers advantages over standard machine learning;methods constrained to use fixed-length feature vectors. We are;applying ILP methods to natural-language learning where we believe;this richer representation offers important advantages. We have;developed an ILP system, CHILL, for learning deterministic parsers;from a corpus of parsed sentences. CHILL obtains superior results on;several artificial corpora previously used to test neural-network;methods, and encouraging results on the more realistic ATIS corpus of;airline queries. CHILL has also been used to the automatically;develop a complete natural-language interface that translates English;database queries into executable Prolog form, producing a more;accurate parser than a hand-built system for querying a small;geographic database. We have also developed an ILP system, FOIDL,;which has been applied to learning the past tense of English,;surpassing the previous results of neural-network and decision-tree;methods on this problem.;Software Reuse by Specialization of Generic Procedures through;Views;Gordon S. Novak Jr.;Software reuse is clearly a good idea, but it is difficult to;achieve in practice: if your data does not fit the assumptions of the;software, reusing the software will be difficult. In our approach,;views describe how application data types implement the abstract types;used in generic procedures. A compilation process can specialize a;generic procedure to produce a version that is customized for the;application data. Graphical user interfaces make it easy to specify;views. An Automatic Programming Server has been implemented on the;World Wide Web; it will write specialized programs for the user, in a;desired language, and serve the source code to the user as a file.;Analysis of Algorithms;Greg Plaxton;A major focus of theoretical computer science is the design and;analysis of asymptotically efficient algorithms;(sequential/parallel/distributed, deterministic/randomized) for;specific computational problems. In this research area, it is not;uncommon to come across well-written papers in which, informally: (i);the main underlying ideas are conceptually straightforward, (ii) the;formal presentation is surprisingly lengthy, and (iii) most of the;formalism deals with minor side-issues and special cases that have;little or nothing to do with the main underlying ideas. In such;papers, there seems to be a significant gap between the conceptual and;formal difficulty of the algorithm being presented. Are such gaps;inherent, or is conventional mathematical notation simply inadequate;for succinctly formalizing certain conceptually straightforward;algorithmic ideas?;In this talk, I will describe a notation for asymptotic analysis,;called $O_i$-notation, that significantly reduces the;""conceptual-to-formal gap"" associated with a non-trivial;class of algorithms. As a concrete example, I consider the analysis;of the well-known linear-time selection algorithm due to Blum, Floyd,;Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan.;The Design and Evaluation of Parallel Algorithms;Vijaya Ramachandran;The design and analysis of efficient parallel algorithms for;combinatorial problems has been an area of extensive study in recent;years, and a large number of algorithms have been developed on the;abstract PRAM model of parallel computation. In this talk we will;describe some of our work in the design of efficient parallel;algorithms, and our experience with implementing and evaluating these;algorithms on a massively parallel machine (Maspar MP-1). We will then;describe a ""queuing"" variant of the PRAM model, which we;propose as a more appropriate model for currently available parallel;shared-memory machines than traditional PRAM models.;Extensible Languages, Open Compilers, and Reflection;Paul Wilson;Extensible languages allow interesting new features to be added to;a language portably, from within the language itself.;Open compilers allow fairly easy modification of compilers to add;new features, analyses, and optimizations.;Reflection allows a program to examine a representation of;interesting parts of itself, and affect its own structure;accordingly.;I'll discuss these things, why they're useful for building modular,;portable, and adapatable software. I'll also discuss our recent work;on the RScheme compiler, an open compiler for an extensible;language.;Last modified: November 15, 1996;Robert Blumofe;rdb@cs.utexas.edu;",course,127,0,14323,[134]

May 1994;Overview (Getting Started);Software components that are used by generators to build software systems are not typical software modules. Components;encapsulate a feature of a domain that many systems of that domain may share. For this to be possible, components must encapsulate;refinements of many different parts (e.g., classes) of a software system. Some of these refinements require the manipulation of;metadata and reflective computations. Thus, it is likely that our basic approach goes beyond simple object-orientation to that of;large-scale program transformations.;To get a feel for the basic issues involved and the breadth of;GenVoca's applicability, I'd recommend the following papers for;starters (and read them in this order):;Scalable Software Libraries;Creating Reference Architectures...;The Design and Implementation...;Composition Validation and Subjectivity...;If you are looking for specific results (improvement in productivity,;performance) that can be delivered by generators, or the;relationship of our work to design patterns, check out (in order):;Reengineering a Complex Application...;P2: A Lightweight DBMS Generator;Memory Simulators and Software Generators;Automated Software Evolution via Design Patterns...;For further information, please contact Don Batory (batory@cs.utexas.edu).
